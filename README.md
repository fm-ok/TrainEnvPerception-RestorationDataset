# Train Environment Perception Image Restoration Dataset

This dataset is released to support academic research on image restoration techniques for improving perception in rail transit systems under adverse environmental conditions. It has been curated specifically for scenarios involving:

- Foggy weather
- Rainy or low-visibility conditions
- Tunnel and nighttime low-light scenes

## 🔍 Background

Reliable environment perception is a key requirement for safe and intelligent train operation, especially in complex weather or lighting conditions. Environmental factors such as fog, rain, and poor illumination often result in degraded images, which severely impact the accuracy of obstacle detection and decision-making systems.

To address these challenges, this dataset supports the evaluation and development of a **Dynamic Hybrid Expert Image Restoration Framework**, which adaptively enhances image clarity and detail in diverse scenarios by integrating multiple expert modules and dynamic fusion strategies.

## 📁 Dataset Contents

The dataset includes image samples for:

- Foggy scene enhancement
- Low-light tunnel image restoration
- Various degraded images and their corresponding clean (ground truth) versions

The dataset is suitable for training and benchmarking deep learning models focused on low-level vision tasks such as dehazing, denoising, and enhancement in transportation environments.
